# Trivia API
This project is a typical trivia game where one can test themselves with questions from 6 different subjects. You can create questions, delete questions, and finally play trivia quizzes for either a specific category, or all categories. This project is part of Udacity's Fullstack Web Developer program. By competing this project, I have learned and applied how to create and structure API endpoints, test those endpoints, and handle errors using HTTP status codes.
